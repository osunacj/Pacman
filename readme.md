# PacMen

## Project

Hello.

The goal of this mini project was to insert and images to the DOM and play with them. I created a pacmen factory. Where a pacmen will move ionside a designated area. Once it reaches the boundries, the pacmen will bounce back.

## How to run

**It is really easy.**

First, simply clone this repo and then open it in your browser. Just like that you can play with the Pacmen factory.

### Future Improvements

In the future I will like to let the user modify the dimension where the pacmen can move.
